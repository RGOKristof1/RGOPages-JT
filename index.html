            <h2>Welcome to the Rusty Rack</h2>
            <p>Deep within the Ironwood Forest, where ancient pines scrape the storm clouds and mist clings to the ground like ghostly fingers, stands the Rusty Rack—a tavern older than memory itself. Its weathered wooden sign creaks in the wind, bearing the faded image of a stag with antlers twisted into impossible angles.</p>
            <p>Whether you seek refuge from the perils of the wilderness, knowledge from seasoned adventurers, or simply a warm meal and stronger drink, the Rusty Rack welcomes all who find its doors.</p>

            <h2>The Lore</h2>
            <div class="lore-section">
                <p><strong>The Tavern's Origins:</strong> Founded over three centuries ago by the legendary ranger Aldric the Unfailing, the Rusty Rack earned its name not from shoddy craftsmanship, but from Aldric's ancient and temperamental iron cooking rack—a relic from a fallen civilization. It is said that Aldric kept this rack because it reminded him of his mortality and the slow decay of all things. Yet somehow, through all these years, the tavern has endured.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="lore-section">
                <p><strong>The Ghost in the Barrel:</strong> Locals whisper of a spirit that dwells within the tavern's oldest barrel of mead. On winter nights when the wind howls fiercest, travelers report seeing luminescent shapes dancing in their cups. The barkeep neither confirms nor denies these tales, but he always keeps that particular barrel locked away, hidden in the deepest corner of the cellar.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="lore-section">
                <p><strong>The Ironwood Bargain:</strong> Long ago, Aldric made a pact with the ancient spirits of Ironwood Forest. In exchange for prosperity and protection, the forest would claim one traveler each generation who carried a troubled heart. Whether they were taken as payment or saved remains unknown—no one has ever seen a body, and not a single guest has gone missing under violent circumstances.</p>

            <h2>The Legend of the Twisted Stag</h2>
            <p>They say on the night of the blood moon, if you drink from the ancient iron mug and speak your deepest regret to the hearth fire, you might catch a glimpse of the Twisted Stag—a magnificent creature with antlers that seem to shift and move of their own accord. Some claim it is Aldric himself, transformed by the price of immortality. Others believe it is the forest's guardian, deciding the fate of those who enter.</p>
            <p>Few who have seen the Twisted Stag have spoken of it. Those who did all agreed on one thing: its eyes held the weight of centuries, and in that moment of meeting, they understood that some truths are too profound for words.</p>
            <p>The Rusty Rack stands ready for your arrival. Will you answer its call?</p>
